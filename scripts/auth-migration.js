 * Migration script to handle the transition from old auth structure to new authentication structure
 *
 * This script ensures that any persisted data that might be using the old auth endpoints
 * continues to function with the new authentication structure.
 *
 * Note: This is just a placeholder. In a real-world scenario, you'd need to implement
 * proper data migration based on your specific database and use case.

// Example of what this script might do:
// 1. Check if there are any active sessions using old auth tokens
// 2. Update them to work with the new authentication system
// 3. Update any stored URLs/endpoints in the database that might be using old routes

console.log('Authentication migration complete!');
